## 🏗️ Example Use Case

```text
1. User tells AI Agent A: "I like hiking in the mountains."
2. Agent A stores this in user's memory via the memory server.
3. Agent B (e.g., a travel assistant) queries the memory and suggests "Top 10 mountain hiking trips near you."
4. All this happens without manual configuration or memory sync between agents.
```
